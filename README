# Ethical Refactoring
This are the samples for the course with the same name. The folders should be self explanatory, however here there is a short description:

- **Documentation** contains the specifications evolved over time for this feature.
- **Preamble** contains the evolution of the code as the specifications changed over time.
- **Refactoring** contains the steps in which we did the refactoring of the code.
- **AnotherRefactoring** contains a different refactoring for the same code, in an object oriented way
